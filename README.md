#Hangman Game using JavaScript

#Description

The assignment was to create a hangman style game completely in JavaScript.

#Usage

The game is simple, and directed by the use of alerts.  The primary driver of the game is to select alpha characters to solve the puzzle.  If you press a non-alpha key or choose a duplicate letter, a popup will alert you to this.  Popups also alert you if you've won or lost.

#Roadmap

This project is not mobile compatible at this time.  Future releases should be able to add fixes to make this a possibility.
