# Hangman Game using JavaScript

## Description

The assignment was to create a Word Guess style game powered by JavaScript code. I chose to create puzzles based on Criterion Collection films.

## Installation

Deployed application:

https://raskog1.github.io/hangman/

## Usage

The game is simple, and guided by the use of alerts. The primary driver of the game is to select alpha characters to solve the puzzle. If you press a non-alpha key or choose a duplicate letter, a popup will alert you to this. Popups also alert you if you've won or lost.

## Roadmap

This project is not mobile compatible at this time. Future releases should be able to add fixes to make this a possibility.

In addition, future releases will eliminate the usage of alerts.
